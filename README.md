# NodeCFT
NodeCFT is a simple infrastructure as code software software tool that allows you to write your AWS infrastructure as a code using nodeJS and CFT. 

You don't need to learn any tool specific commands to work with NodeCF like other infrastructure as code software tools like, Terraform or Pulumi.

All you need to know is NodeJS and CFT.

More information on how to use NodeCFT, check my boilerplate project on https://github.com/priyanthag/NodeCFT-boilerplate

## Limitations
  -  Stack Deletion is not supporting yet
  -  Nested Stack creation is not Tested properly yet, May not work as expected if you use nested CTFs
